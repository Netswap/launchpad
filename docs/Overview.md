# Overview

The Netswap Launchpad is a fair platform for conducting IDOs for projects built on Metis Andromeda.

We defined two different tires on Netswap Launchpad: **Primary Tier(Basic Model)** and **Unlimited Tier(Unlmited Model)**.

There are four main periods for both two tiers: **Staking Period, Vesting Period, Cashing Period and Ended**.

During staking period, eligible users can stake/unstake required tokens at any time.

If the IDO failed after staking period, users can also unstake their staked tokens.

If the IDO reached success requirements after staking period, users need to wait for the end of vesting period and then cash sale token and claim back staked token at the same time during cashing period. That means users can't only claim back their staked token without cashing sale token during cashing period. After cashing period, users without cashing during cashing period can claim back their staked tokens.

For projects, they need to apply to info@netswap.io with [required information](./RequiredInformation.md) to add new pads for their project token. And then we will contact project team to make a plan for project launch.

After cashing period, admin of specific pad can withdraw unsold tokens and raised tokens through model contracts.

We only support stable coin to be the payment token for each sales.

Both two tires support whitelist access and airdrop.

## Primary Tier - Basic Model

Primary Tier is made for retail investors, there will be a limit on METIS or NETT token staking amount for per users.

For example, we might set the staking limit to $50â€“300 worth of METIS/NETT token, but the specific limits will depend on IDO token sale amount/price in each event. No participation fee is charged in Primary Tier.

Check more details on [BasicModel](./BasicModel.md).

## Unlimited Tier - Unlimited Model

Unlimited Tier is more appealing to those who hold a larger amount of assets. In Unlimited Tier, you can stake an unlimited amount of METIS/NETT token to get more IDO token allocations.

Meanwhile, a participation fee will be charged during the token sale for Unlimited Tier, the participation fee rate will be dependent on your actual staked amount and overflow multiplier of soft staking cap.
